# Homework 05 – Caesar Cipher Script (Short Passive README)

## A. Constructing the source set (SET1)
A source character set was created using the full English alphabet in both uppercase (`A–Z`) and lowercase (`a–z`).  
This set served as the reference alphabet for performing rotations.

---

## B. Constructing the target set (SET2)
The rotation value provided by the user was normalized with modulo 26 to support values larger than the alphabet length.  
SET2 was then generated by shifting the characters of SET1 to the right by the rotation amount, wrapping around the alphabet as needed.

---

## C. Performing the encryption
The `tr` command was used to translate characters from SET1 to SET2.  
Input text received from `stdin` was transformed according to this mapping.
